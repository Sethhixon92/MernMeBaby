In this challenge we had to set up an Apollo Server to use GraphQL querries and mutations to fetch and modify data, replacing the RESTful API. We also have to update the existing middleware so that it works with GraphQL. We also had to use an Apollo Provider so it can also run with the server. Lastly we had to deploy the application to Heroku.
